Call QuoteWithArg(inst) on each bar

UNWANTED CUE NAMES

	to get rid of unwanted instraument name cues where there are multiple voices in a quote...
	... switch the instrument to a custom "silenct" version with cue name ""

how to solve the damned ottava bug?

Maybe ottava simply works BEFORE \Q - interacts with \inst though!
A) ottava down works before \Q
unless
B) \instrumentChange in which case place inside {}


THOUGHT - restate clef ??
